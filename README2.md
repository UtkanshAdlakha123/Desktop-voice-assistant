It is a voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses speech recognition, speech processing algorithms, and speech synthesis to listen to specific voice commands, return relevant information, and perform specific functions at the request of the user.

As we know Python is a competent language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need. 

Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is ordinarily used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing. So here we will look at converting large or long audio files into text using the SpeechRecognition API in python.
